**TODO:**
- [ ] Add three topics: `AI-Tournaments`, `Ai-Tournaments-Participant` and the full name of the arena repository (e.g `AI-Tournaments--Arena-Template`, note that `/` is replaced by `--`).
- [ ] Don't use external dependencies. Remote communication is terminated by default, instead include the source in `participant.js`. See [file header dependencies](https://github.com/AI-Tournaments/AI-Tournaments.github.io#dependencies).
