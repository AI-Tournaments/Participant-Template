**TODO:**
- [ ] Add three topics: `AI-Tournaments`, `Participant` and the name of the arena (without the `-Arena` suffix) or use the full repository name (`UserAuthor/Example-Arena`) if this is a participant for a community arena.
- [ ] Don't use external dependencies. Internet communication is terminated by default.
